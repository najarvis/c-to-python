# c-to-python
A test to take a function in C and call it using python. The algorithm used is a modified diamond-square algorithm.

# Requirements
python (used 2.7.11 in this instance, I believe it should work in python 3 if you can get pygame for Python 3)
pygame (used 1.9.1 release)

# Usage
to compile the c code, you can just call:

`bash compile.txt`

and to call the python code afterward:

`python mid_dis.py`

# Example
